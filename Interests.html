        <h2>Better Begin with the B's</h2>
        <p>Bunnies, Belize, Babies, and more.  It wasn't until developing this site that I realized how many of my favorite things begin with the letter B!</p>
        <h3>Bunnies</h3>
        <p>Bunnies have always been my favorite animal.  A few reasons immediately come to mind:
    <ul>
        <li>Their little noses are just so darn cute!</li>
        <li>When they hop and bounce it is far more entertaining than simple walking or running that other animals do.</li>
        <li>They can be litter box trained.</li>
        <li>Their waste is excellent fertilizer (and far less stinky than other pets)!</li>
        <li>They are incapable of vomiting.</li>
    </ul></p>
        <h3>Belize</h3>
        <p>Having always loved travel far and near I was lucky enough to be introduced to Belize in 1998.  I immediately fell in love with this country and am excited to share some of the reasons... 
            <UL>
                <li>Proximity to the coral reef is excellent for SCUBA diving.</li>
                <li>You can easily spend equal time on the beach/in the water and exploring the jungle.</li>
                <li>The people of Belize are known for their kindness and sense of humor.</li>
                <li>Rich in culture & history you will learn something new every time you visit.</li>
                <li>THe food... YUM!</li>
            </UL></p>
        <h3>Babies</h3>
          <p>My love for babies began as young as I can remember.  I enjoyed babysitting (hey, another B!) from the age of 11 on.  Having my own children has been the most rewarding experience in life, and something I always knew I wanted.  But why babies?</p>
            <Ul>
                <li>Every moment of their being they are learning something new, and as older humans we get to observe this.  It is fascinatin!</li>
                <li>Their love is unconditional.</li>
                <li>Every act of helping them meet basic phsyical needs or engaging and helping them build emotinal connecations is an opportunity to make a huge difference in a life.</li>
            </Ul>  
        <h3>Bilingual</h3>
        <p>Learning languages has always been a passion of mine.  In fact when I was little I would just make up my own!  Perhaps this is why the world of coding is so fascinating to me, after all it really is just another language.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>I started learning Spanish in High School.  I intended to Minor in Spanish but wasn't satisfied with how much I had learned so continued on to achieve a second degree in college.</li>
              <li>Italian came next.  Though not starting with this language until college I have found that retention is much more difficult.</li>
              <li>Someday I would love to learn additional languages, likely in this order...</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creole</li>
                    <li>Latin</li>
                    <li>Portuguese</li>
                </ol>
          </ul></div>
